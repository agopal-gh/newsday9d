<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"Bahnschrift",sans-serif;color:black'>Elon Musk has announced that
he will be pulling out of the $44 billion deal of purchasing Twitter, as the
company failed to produce information on spam bots. For context, on 14th April
2022, the richest man on earth announced that he would be buying the popular
social media company Twitter for over $44 billion, in order to become the
world’s largest shareholder. Subsequently, on 25th April, the board of
directors at Twitter unanimously accepted this offer. However, Musk had a list
of terms and conditions in a letter filed with the US Securities and Exchange
Commission. One of these terms was for Twitter to gather information on
Spambots, as Musk had a goal to improve Twitter by removing these. Upon seeing
how Twitter had not fulfilled this term, Musk decided that he did not want to
work with a company which did not care enough about the deal. Therefore, he has
announced that he will be leaving the deal. Unfortunately for Elon though, the
price of not completing the transaction is $1 billion. Nevertheless, the
Twitter Chairman Bret Taylor tweeted about how the company was going to ensure
that the deal was secured. “The Twitter Board is committed to closing the
transaction </span><img width=314 height=316 src="elonmusk_files/image002.jpg"

the price and terms agreed upon with Mr. Musk and plans to pursue legal action
to enforce the merger agreement. We are confident we will prevail in the
Delaware Court of Chancery.” However, Tesla CEO’s lawyers responded, saying how
in the filing Twitter had failed or refused to comply with numerous requests on
information about fake or spam accounts. Musk has repeatedly said that the
information on these spam bots would prove crucial to Twitter’s business
performance, and he had previously openly said how he would cancel the deal if
Twitter does not give him this data. &quot;Twitter is in material breach of
multiple provisions of that Agreement, appears to have made false and
misleading representations upon which Mr. Musk relied when entering into the
Merger Agreement,&quot; as read the letter. Due to this deal being a failure,
many in the general public will feel more relieved such as leftists like those
in the Labour Party and other defenders of social media censorship, many of
whom despise the prospect of a “free speech absolutist” who reads Breitbart
News articles taking ownership of Twitter. Nevertheless, Musk likely will not
be able to walk away from the deal, as he supposedly intended, as because of
the Twitter board’s obstinance, it may not be entirely over, as they still did
not accept the deal and could still sue Musk to complete the takeover.</span></p>
