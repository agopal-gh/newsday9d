alt="After 3 seasons of pure entertainment, Stranger Things is back after a long hiatus due to Covid-19. &#13;&#10;Many plot lines are continued such as&#8239;missing Hopper, Eleven loses her powers and the town of Hawkins after a 'mall fire' (which we know was actually the result of the Mind Flayer's tyranny). In Season 4, many of the plot lines are developed – leading to a compelling interesting story. &#13;&#10; &#13;&#10;Stranger Things Season 4 was also released in 'volumes' (episodes being released in parts).&#8239; This was a clever marketing ploy by Netflix as it enabled people to discuss the show after episodes were launched – as a pose to quickly forgetting about the season due to it being ended with nothing to discuss. The segmented release has allowed people to talk about the show – resulting in lots of buzz for the Stranger Things Season 4.&#8239; &#13;&#10; &#13;&#10;Reviews for this season have also been overwhelmingly positive, with many people saying this season is one of the best seasons. With so much interest around the show, people are obviously inclined to watch Stranger Things Season 4! &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;"></p>
